### [F-005] @all · DECISION · OPEN · 2026-06-28
**Anti-slop design protocol is in the repo: `frontend/SLOP-CHECK.md`** ([PR #3](https://github.com/Welddevelopment/Tender_Breakdown_AI-Agent/pull/3)).
**If you add a wireframe of a screen, run it past this first.** It is a short gate (greyscale test, name one
intentional choice, banned-list scan, real content) plus a hard banned list: no blue/teal/purple, no em dashes
in copy, no eyebrow labels, no numbered website sections, no ugly pills, no really long headlines, and more.
Following it makes the frontend handoff faster and means less rework on my side. Palette is locked to Paper and
Forest; typeface is still mine to pick. Exceptions or edge cases: tag @frontend.

### [F-004] @backend · INFO · OPEN · 2026-06-28
**Live integration smoke-tested green locally — your contract holds, no frontend changes needed.** Ran your
scaffolded backend end-to-end (heuristic, no key) and pointed the real frontend at it (`localhost:3000` →
`localhost:8000`). Results: `spso-cleaning.pdf` → **21 requirements**; `GET /tenders/{id}/requirements`
matches the locked schema **field-for-field** (all requirement keys + `capability_docs` on the response);
`PATCH /requirements/{id}` persisted a decision across a re-GET; **CORS passes from the real browser origin**
incl. the `PATCH` preflight (`access-control-allow-origin: http://localhost:3000`). So when you're back and
swap heuristic→OpenAI, the UI just lights up — nothing to coordinate on shapes. **One note for the demo:**
heuristic returns thin content (0 gating, no `answer`/`open_questions`), so the live path currently renders
my honest empty states — expected, matches your J-011. We keep the **mock as the hero showcase** until the
OpenAI key lands; live path proves the pipeline. Full detail in `Jawad's progress day 1.md`.

### [F-003] @j · REQUEST · OPEN · 2026-06-28
**I need the deployed backend's public URL** (Render, per `backend/DEPLOY.md`) to make the *hosted* site
show live data. Frontend is already wired to the live API (see F-002) — the moment you post the URL here,
I'll set `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` in Vercel and the hosted demo goes live. Matches your
`frontend-integration.md` note (Vercel's mine, backend hosting's yours). No rush for local — that already
works against `localhost:8000`; this is purely for the deployed demo. Ping me back with the URL when it's up. 🙏

### [F-002] @all · INFO · OPEN · 2026-06-28
**Frontend↔backend integration is merged** ([PR #2](https://github.com/Welddevelopment/Tender_Breakdown_AI-Agent/pull/2)).
`src/lib/api.ts` calls all three endpoints; it's **env-gated on `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL`** — unset = mock
+ wireframe upload (demo-safe default, so the hosted site is unchanged today); set = real
upload→extract→matrix + decisions persisted via `PATCH`. The autofill UI renders `answer` /
`open_questions` / `capability_docs` when the pipeline produces them and **degrades gracefully if they're
absent**, so the heuristic-only path is fine for now. @backend/@generalist: no shape changes needed — you
emit the locked schema, the UI adapts.

### [F-001] @all · INFO · OPEN · 2026-06-28
**Frontend now ships via PR + merge** (not direct-to-`main`) for visibility — expect PRs on the
Welddevelopment repo from here on. Also live this session: answer + evidence panel + gap-interview UI
(new `/answers` route), Bidframe rebrand, and the autofill schema mirror — all on `main` + deployed. Current
frontend state is in `STATUS.md`; my detailed log is `Jawad's progress day 1.md`.
